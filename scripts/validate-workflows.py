BookVerse Platform Service - GitHub Actions Workflow Validation System

This module implements comprehensive validation for GitHub Actions workflows in the
BookVerse platform, ensuring workflow integrity, configuration compliance, and
platform-specific requirements for CI/CD pipeline reliability and enterprise-grade
automation standards.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview:
    - Workflow Validation: Comprehensive YAML syntax and structure validation
    - Platform Requirements: BookVerse-specific workflow requirement checking
    - Authentication Validation: Shared authentication workflow usage verification
    - CI/CD Compliance: Platform aggregation logic and process validation
    - Error Reporting: Detailed validation results with actionable feedback
    - Automation Integration: CI/CD pipeline integration for automated validation

üöÄ Key Features:
    - YAML syntax validation with comprehensive error reporting
    - Platform-specific workflow requirement validation and compliance checking
    - Shared authentication workflow usage verification and best practices
    - Platform aggregation logic validation for core platform functionality
    - Detailed validation reporting with clear success and failure indicators
    - CI/CD integration support for automated workflow validation

üîß Technical Implementation:
    - YAML Parser: Safe YAML loading with comprehensive error handling
    - Pattern Matching: Platform-specific logic detection and validation
    - Path Resolution: Flexible workflow file discovery and processing
    - Error Handling: Graceful error handling with detailed failure reporting
    - Configuration Analysis: Deep workflow structure analysis and validation

üìä Business Logic:
    - Quality Assurance: Ensures CI/CD pipeline reliability and consistency
    - Platform Standards: Enforces BookVerse platform-specific requirements
    - Development Efficiency: Prevents workflow errors before deployment
    - Compliance Verification: Validates adherence to platform standards
    - Risk Mitigation: Reduces deployment failures through comprehensive validation

üõ†Ô∏è Usage Patterns:
    - Pre-commit Validation: Local workflow validation before code commit
    - CI/CD Integration: Automated validation in pull request workflows
    - Platform Maintenance: Regular validation of existing workflow configurations
    - Development Workflow: Integration in developer tooling and IDE extensions
    - Release Validation: Pre-release workflow validation for deployment safety
